# eCommerce - Jagermeister design

### Test the application: [eCommerceJagermeister](https://sionut0122.github.io/ecommercejager/)

#### I built this personal project because i wanted to create an ecommerce website and integrate the three.js library. This website is meant to behave like a real ecommerce.

#### The user can:
    - view products info
    - navigate to the shop page
	- add products to cart
	- select quantity
    - store products to localStorage
    - view cart and remove existing products
	- checkout & finish the order 

## Description
	 The user can add a product with the selected quantity from the shop page into the cart.The products are stored inside the localStorage until those are removed manually.

	 Inside cart, user will be able to:
	  	- update the product's quantity
	  	- remove product
	 If everything looks good, the user can proceed to the next step - Checkout page;

	 Inside the checkout, the steps that must be followed will be displayed on the top.

	  > On the second step, user must fill out the fields with the delivery address.

	  > On the third step, the payment method has to be selected. After that, user can proceed with the order by clicking the 'Pay' button.

## Technology used:

- HTML, SCSS, Javascript
- React.js, React-redux, React-router
- Three.js
